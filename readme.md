# About A3-wm
Inspired by i3-wm on linux window management, but using windows 11. I decided to implement a similar functionality on windows using the language V and win32 windows APIs.

It still has a lot of bugs, but we'll keep moving forward.

## To do
 - [x] multiple monitors
 - [x] adjust window side by side horizontally
 - [x] swap window position with other window
 - [x] attach new window to current grid horizontally
 - [] adjust window side by side vertically
 - [] attach new window to current grid vertically
 - [] add new window anywhere
 - [] drag and put window anywhere
 - [] change grid direction
 - [] set/unset window fullscreen
 - [] create other workspaces
 - [] send window to other workspaces
 - [] add config file


## Example

`v -cc msvc run .`
