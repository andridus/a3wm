# About A3-wm
Inspired by i3-wm on linux window management, but using windows 11. I decided to implement a similar functionality on windows using the language V and win32 windows APIs.

It still has a lot of bugs, but we'll keep moving forward.


## Example
![me](./images/a3wm.gif)

## Execute.
install the Visual Studio for msvc compiler.

`v -cc msvc run .`
